# Plummer

Here are some results for the projected quantities for a Plummer model that you can use to fit for the black hole.

The first is the projected surface density:

&Sigma; = M a<sup>2</sup> &pi; (R<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>-2</sup>

The second is the projected velocity dispersion squared without the black hole:

&sigma;<sup>2</sup> = 3 &pi; G M/64 (a<sup>2</sup> + R<sup>2</sup> )<sup>-1/2</sup>
