# Plummer

Here are some results for the projected quantities for a Plummer model that you can use to fit for the black hole.

The first is the projected surface density:

&Sigma; = M a<sup>2</sup> &pi; (R<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>-2</sup>

The second is the projected velocity dispersion squared without the black hole:

&sigma;<sup>2</sup> = 3 &pi;/64 G M/a (1 + (R/a)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>-1/2</sup>

The square of the velocity dispersion with the black hole is contained within the file blacksigma2.dat. The projected radius is in the first column; the units for the projected radius are a.  The second column contains the velocity dispersion squared in units of G M<sub>bh</sub>/a.
